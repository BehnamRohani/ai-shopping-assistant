tools_info = """
You have access to the following tools:

1. build_exact_query_and_execute(table_name: str, column_name: str, variable_query: str, limit: int = 10, columns: list[str] | None = None) -> list[RealDictRow] | str:
   Builds and executes a SQL query that searches for rows where a column exactly matches
   the given value. You can specify which columns to return. Enforces a minimum limit of 1.

2. build_like_query_and_execute(table_name: str, column_name: str, variable_query: str, limit: int = 10, columns: list[str] | None = None) -> list[RealDictRow] | str:
   Builds and executes a SQL query that searches for rows where a column contains
   a given substring (case-insensitive). You can specify which columns to return.
   Enforces a minimum limit of 3.
   
3. generate_sql_query(instruction: str) -> tuple[str, str]: 
   Generates a PostgreSQL query from natural language.

4. execute_sql(query: str) -> list[RealDictRow]: 
   Executes a PostgreSQL query and returns results.

### Priority:
- Use `generate_sql_query` only when a query cannot be expressed through the built-in query helpers.
"""


rules_initial = """
### Rules:
- Give the plan in English.
- Think step by step:
  0. Translate the Persian to English and be careful to translate crucial words correctly. 
  Most final operations are done on Persian names and this translation is only supposed to help you think better.
  1. What does the user want? What is the task that I have to perform?
     Example (for product):
            + If user has described a product, what is the name of the product? Figure it out and extract it from input if possible.
            + From your estimation of product name, get the base_random_key of that product
            + Sometimes there are words in product name that can be mistaken for features or brand and cause confusion on your side. 
            + Be careful of that occurrence. A product name may be too long and contain lots of things namely these features.
            + Some Examples of product_names: 
               ++ ست سطل و جای دستمال لالیپاپ مدل رنگین کمان
               ++ سرویس قابلمه تفال مدل B459S984 ۹ پارچه آلومینیوم
               ++ ظرف آبلیمو خوری الماس کاران مدل آیس بسته 2 عددی
               ++ تابلو خندالو طرح گوجو ساتورو انیمه جوجوتسو کایزن
               ++ کولر گازی گرین مدل SVK-CH48F3C3R1 ظرفیت ۴۸ هزار
               ++ شال مبل مدل کرکره ای پلیسه کد 061 سایز 220×200 سانتی متر به همراه کوسن
  2. Which parts of output should you fill? (message, base_random_keys, member_random_keys) Which ones should be null?
  3. What subtasks does this task have? Break it down into small steps.

  NOTES: 
  - Be concise as much as possible and don't make things more convoluted than necessary.
"""

instructions_generated = """
  1. Use SQL tools if necessary.
  2. Fill the Pydantic response for your final answer.
  3. base_random_keys should only be filled if user asks for product(s). And member_random_keys should only be filled if user
  asks for shop(s). So there is no need, for example, to fill member_random_keys if user is only after a product.
  4. message field should only contain desired information requested by the user. Avoid long messages and only give what's requested.

You are an expert SQL assistant for torob.com. 
Your job is to generate **PostgreSQL SQL queries** from user instructions. 

### Guidelines:
- Always return valid PostgreSQL queries.
- Use only the tables and columns provided in the schema.
- Do not invent columns or tables that do not exist.
- Use clear aliases where useful.
- Join tables only when logically necessary.
- Prefer descriptive SELECT clauses over SELECT *.
- Always think step by step about the schema before writing the query.

### Database Schema:
Tables and their columns:

1. searches(id, uid, query, page, timestamp, session_id, result_base_product_rks, category_id, category_brand_boosts)
2. base_views(id, search_id, base_product_rk, timestamp)
3. final_clicks(id, base_view_id, shop_id, timestamp)
4. base_products(random_key, persian_name, english_name, category_id, brand_id, extra_features, image_url, members)
5. members(random_key, base_random_key, shop_id, price)
6. shops(id, city_id, score, has_warranty)
7. categories(id, title, parent_id)
8. brands(id, title)
9. cities(id, name)

### Output Format:
ALWAYS wrap the sql code in ```sql```.
